# Form Implementation with Formik and Yup

In this project, a form was created using Formik and Yup to handle form state management and validation. Formik simplifies the process of creating and managing forms in React, while Yup provides a powerful schema-based validation solution.

### Technologies Used

* __Formik__: A popular library for building and managing forms in React.
* __Yup__: A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
